"""
A perfect matching is a matching that matches all vertices of the graph. That is, a matching is perfect if every vertex
of the graph is incident to an edge of the matching.

Let G=(V, E) be an undirected simple graph, and let $T$ be its associated Tutte matrix. Then, det(T) = 0 if and only
if $G$ has a perfect matching.

To speed up the detection of perfect matchings, I used Schwartz-Zippel's Theorem: Suppose det(T) = 0; then suppose
each variable in T was set to an element in {1, . . . , n2} uniformly at random within the {1,n**2} interval.
Then, P[det(T)(x) = 0] â‰¤ 1/n, where the randomness is taken over the setting of each variable.
